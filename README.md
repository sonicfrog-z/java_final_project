# java_final_project
Summary: Write a	program	that	will	determine the	letter	grade	of	students	of a	class (university	class, not	java	class) using	your	understanding	of	class (java	class),	objects,	exception	handling,	and	collection in	Java.

Description: Your	program	will	need	to	accept	two	command	line	arguments.		The	first	argument	will	be the	name	of	a	disk	file	that	contains	the	names	of	students,	and	their	test	scores,	separated	by	commas followed	by	one	or	more	spaces.	Each	line	in	the	file	will	contain	scores	for	one	student. The	second	argument	will	be	the	name	of	an	output	disk	file.		Your	program will	create	a	new	output	disk	file	using	that	name.		The	output	file will have	grade	information	of	all	students	whose	information	was	read	from	input	file,	in	a	sorted	order. You	will	be	writing	one	line	in	the	output	file	for	one	student.		You	will	write	name	of	one	student	and	the	letter	grade	he/she	got	in	the	class	in	each	line (you	should	format	the	texts	in	the	output	file).	The	format	of	the	data	in	the	input	file	is	fixed,	however	the	number	of	students	in	the	input	file	is	unknown	during	compile	time.	The	name	of	input	and	output	files	could	be	anything	and	only	known	during	run	time. Besides	writing	to	the	output	file,	you	will	also	need	to	display	the	averages	of	scores	along	with	minimum	and	maximum	scores	for	each	test	in	the	screen/console.
